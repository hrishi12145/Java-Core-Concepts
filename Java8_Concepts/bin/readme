The Key Differences - Lambda Expression vs Anonymous Class 

1. Lambda expression can be used where a class implements a functional interface 
to reduce the complexity of the code.

2. An inner anonymous class is more powerful as we can use many methods as we want, 
whereas lambda expression can only be used where an interface has only a single abstract method.

3. For Lambda Expression at the time of compilation, no .class file fill be generated.

4. For the Anonymous Inner class at the time of compilation, a separate .class file will be generated.

5.The Performance of the lambda expression is better as it is pure compile-time activity and doesnâ€™t incur
extra cost during runtime.

6.However, the Performance of the anonymous inner class is lower as requires class loading at runtime

1.Lambda expression - forEach - Done
2.Default method - multiple interface extends class then override the method and print the method using Lambda expression .
3.static Method - Overridding -- multiple interface
4.Method Reference - 3 Ques
5.Stream API - Read Concept
